# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

Hello.
This is all of my projects done for the course porpuses. 
They might been a little bit different than version submited for each challenges, but the general idea of the files stays the same ( it's simply beacause im a bit chaotic person with ADHD and sometimes i've made some changes and forgot to save them, or saved them to soon)

i work in Amazon IT department and im not a new person to eerything what this course include BUT, i am actually very suprised how well organised it is. And definetly this will give boost to my career, 

It just massivly helped me organise my skills, I knew bits and pieces, well maybe more than bits and pieces but now i can actually categorise my knowledge in a sense where i actually know what im doing using certain language, i know them but i don't know know them if it makes sense.

Once again forgieve me for beeing chaotic, but this is how i work. Still trying to improve and thanks to this course i am sure i will.
